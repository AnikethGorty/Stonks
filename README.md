I try to create a stock market simulator. 

14 March 2025 UPDATE:

I have made some kind of skeletal framework for this app. Using docker for containing the whole thing and pip installing my files for me. 
Python: I'm using flask library for web-based interactions. May move it offline someday, idk tho. 
I'm using AlphaVantage for historical data which will train the db.
Pandas, numpy etc for the actual training until I become competent enough to use Tensorflow. 


If you wanna quickly test/iterate this thing, just copy the code from the python file to google collab and run it there, then copy it back to VSCode. 
Over there we probably don't need Flask. Actually why do we need flask? We need to use JavaScript(gotta learn that quick) for the interaction between frontend and backend, and we'll use something like flutter to make an app to do all this stuff. Lets keep python to just the Machine Learning part.
